# Legal-Ease

## Inspiration
Legal Ease AI was inspired by the struggles that immigrants and non-citizens face in navigating the legal system. As an immigrant, Dakshi has seen firsthand how confusing and overwhelming it can be to access legal resources, understand rights, and find trustworthy information. Many people are unaware of their rights, leading to fear, exploitation, and legal troubles. Seeing the lack of accessible and affordable legal aid, we wanted to build a tool that could simplify legal information, provide guidance, and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their legal situations.

## What it does
Legal Ease AI is an AI-powered legal assistant that helps immigrants, non-citizens, and underserved communities understand their legal rights, access legal resources, and get guidance on immigration, work permits, tenant rights, and more. Users can:
Ask legal questions and receive AI-generated responses based on verified legal sources.
Get guidance on common legal processes (e.g., visa applications, asylum procedures, deportation defense).
Find local legal aid organizations and pro bono attorneys for further assistance.
## How we built it
We built Legal Ease AI using Google Gemini AI, Google Cloud API, Node.js, Typescript, React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating Google Gemini AI effectively into our platform. Ensuring accurate legal responses while handling complex legal language and context was difficult, requiring extensive fine-tuning and verification with real legal sources. Additionally, Gemini’s multimodal capabilities were challenging to optimize for document analysis and multilingual support, but we overcame this by refining our prompts and combining them with other AI models for better accuracy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building an AI-driven legal aid platform that makes law more accessible to underserved communities.
## What we learned
Legal accessibility is a huge issue. Many people don’t seek legal help because they think it’s too expensive or complicated.

Connecting with legal aid organizations can expand the reach of Legal Ease AI and ensure users get real legal support when needed.
## What's next for LEGAL EASE AI 
Expanding our legal database to cover more areas of law, including workers' rights, tenant laws, and criminal justice.
Launching a mobile app for easier access to legal aid on the go.
Partnering with legal aid organizations to provide real-time attorney assistance through the platform.
Enhancing AI accuracy by integrating case law and court rulings into responses.
Voice-based legal assistance so users can speak their legal questions instead of typing.
AI-powered legal form generation, helping users fill out immigration or legal documents with step-by-step guidance.
